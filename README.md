Repository for the R notebook and the music generated

WHAT IS PLANT TO MUSIC?

PLANT TO MUSIC is an R notebook (.rmd file) I created that contains a series of R code snippets and annotations to allow students to convert their lab data to music. It is part of the unofficial 2hr long R workshop in the Drakakaki Lab and is meant to encourage student engagement and make R -- and data processing -- more fun and less intimidating. 

IT IS MEANT FOR PEOPLE WITH NO PRIOR PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE. The code in the .rmd file (which you can open by installing R and R Studio, both free) is the simplest code possible that can convert numerica data into auditory frequency within the preferred human hearing range. It is not the best way to do this conversion nor the most elegant, but hopefully the way that requires the least amount of programming knowledge to understand.

YOU CANNOT DIRECTLY PLAY THE MUSIC IN R. R is a statistical language and doesn't really come with a build in sound library or a structure that makes it easy to play audio files. You CAN integrate it with other languages that can play sounds...but that's beyond the scope of the original PLANT TO MUSIC project.

THE NOTES GENERATED AT THE END OF THE .RMD FILE WILL NOT SOUND LIKE MUSIC IF YOU PLAY IT AS IS. You'll have to use other programming languages or apps to play around with the tempo, the instrument, and the harmony to get something that is recognizably a song. (There are notes to this effect and suggested apps and webpages at the end of the .rmd file.) Again, this was created to give people with no programming background a fun way to engage with R and students who'd never worked in a lab before a new way to think (audibly) about their data. This is NOT meant to be a self-contained music making app or a workshop for advanced statistical work in R.


...but, if you think this may be useful for what you're doing / the training you need to provide to your mentees, go ahead and give it a shot. Let me know how it turns out and if you guys generated any cool music in the end.
